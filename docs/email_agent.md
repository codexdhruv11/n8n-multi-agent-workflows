# üìß Email Agent ‚Äì Workflow Documentation

## 1. **Workflow Title**

**Email Agent**
*(from JSON: `"email_Agent"`)*

## 2. **Workflow Purpose**

The **Email Agent** is a sub-agent designed to process natural language instructions related to email tasks. It can generate and send emails or fetch emails from a Gmail inbox based on user queries. This workflow integrates with LangChain agents and is typically triggered by a parent orchestrator like the **Supervisor Agent**.
