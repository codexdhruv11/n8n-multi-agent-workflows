# üìÜ Calendar Agent ‚Äì Workflow Documentation

## 1. **Workflow Title**

**Calendar Agent**
*(from JSON: `"Calender"` ‚Äì assumed corrected spelling to ‚ÄúCalendar‚Äù)*

---

## 2. **Workflow Purpose**

The **Calendar Agent** acts as an AI-powered assistant responsible for managing calendar-related tasks using Google Calendar. It can create events, create meetings with attendees, or fetch existing events based on natural language instructions. This workflow integrates into a multi-agent system (e.g., Supervisor Agent) where it handles calendar-specific responsibilities.

---

## 3. **Trigger Type**

* **Type:** `Execute Workflow Trigger`
* **Description:** This workflow is invoked by another workflow, such as the Supervisor Agent, through an Execute Workflow call. It expects an input query that describes a calendar-related action in natural language.
* **Expected Input Example:**

```json
{
  "query": "setup an event at 3 pm for meeting, event name n8n"
}
```

### üîπ Calendar Agent

* **Type:** `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`

## 8. **Notes for Extension**

### üí° Extension Suggestions:

* **Add Timezone Handling:** Ensure start/end times respect user‚Äôs local timezone.
* **Event Reminders:** Add optional reminder notifications via email or Telegram.
* **Recurring Events:** Extend to support repeat rules (e.g., weekly meetings).
* **Conflict Detection:** Check for overlapping events before scheduling.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions:

* Google Calendar account `dhruvkaushikjee9457@gmail.com` is properly authorized.
* User queries are clear enough for the AI to infer date/time/attendee correctly.
* This agent only handles **single-attendee** meetings; multi-participant logic must be added if needed.
